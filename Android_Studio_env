[To move the project to another location]

Copy the project directory from source to destination machine. Then follow the steps.

Open Android Studio
Go to File - > Open
Browse to the project location.
Select build.gradle and open.
Android Studio will automatically make the necessary changes for the target machine and set up the project.

NOTE : It usually confuses the first timers, as after copying project files into target machine, when you try to open the project, 
it considers it as a normal directory, not as android project.
